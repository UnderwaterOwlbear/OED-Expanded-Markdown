VERBOSE EDITION

Original Edition Delta

What is OED?

OED is a short set of house rules for Original D&D (1974 edition).

Many of us find the original game the purest, most playable, most
DM-friendly version, but it does have some gaps and confusing points.
OED clarifies and streamlines various topics to make these rules more
approachable to the modern gamer.

What are the main modifications?

-   All combat actions are rolled d20 + level + modifiers, with success
    on 20 or more (no tables!).
-   Wizards can't memorize duplicate spells (more variety!).
-   Clerics are removed (scarier undead and injuries!).
-   Money is silver standard (more value for PC gold!).
-   Encumbrance is historical stone unites (easier numbers!).
-   Melee weapons each get a simple, unique benefit.
-   All the monsters and magic work like core D&D.

Where can I get it?

The OED rules supplement is free for download at OED Games
([*www.oedgames.com*](http://www.oedgames.com/)). And don't forget,
scans of the Original D&D core rules can be bought at RPGNow.com (search
for "Original Edition").

Core Mechanic

Original Edition Delta uses Target 20 for combat and resolution with the
same results as D&D, but no tables or new statistics required.

What Is Target 20?

Target 20 is an easy and elegant way to adjudicate combat in classic D&D
-- without any tables or new statistics, using just the original rules.
Here's the basic idea: **Every roll is d20 + level + modifiers, with a
result of 20 or more indicating success.**

Easy, right? Many DMs have been using this to simplify their games for
years now. The mechanic is purely additive, which most people find
easier than an inverse-subtraction method (e.g., THACO). The target is
always 20, and AC is just another added modifier -- there's no need to
invent a new target score for every opponent or skill check (e.g., as in
the d20 System). Here's some more detail:

Attack Rolls

Attacks are resolved by rolling **d20 + fighter level + modifiers +
target AC** (success on 20 or more). For actual fighters and monsters,
the base addition is just their level or hit dice (for other classes, we
take a ratio: ⅔ level for clerics and thieves; ½ level for wizards).
Players may wish to document their total attack adjustments; but the DM
doesn't need any new stats, because they just add the HD value for any
attacking monsters. When PCs attack a monster, we usually keep the AC
secret and add it mentally after the player announces their roll; note
that using the classic descending AC means that the better the armor,
the less an attacker gets to add.

Saving Throws

Saving throws work likewise: **roll d20 + character level + modifiers**
(success on 20 or more). The modifiers in this case are by type of save:
+0 vs. spells, +1 vs. breath, +2 vs. stone, +3 vs. wands, +4 vs. death.
With this simplification, we don't even bother to record saving scores
on PC sheets anymore.

Thief Skills

Thief skills get the same treatment: **roll d20 + thief level +
modifiers** (success on 20 or more). We grant the thief's Dexterity
modifier as a bonus to this roll. We don't even bother writing down
separate skill categories with this streamlining.

How Accurate Is It?

In 2018 we learned that the [*pre-publication
draft*](http://playingattheworld.blogspot.com/2018/09/why-did-armor-class-descend-from-9-to-2.html)
of the original D&D rules used no combat tables, and was instead based
on a simple formula equivalent to the one we have here. You\'ll see a
link from that site back to our blog, where we deduced this fact a
decade or more prior. Compared to the table versions that we do see in
the official books, Target 20 tends to produce results, on average,
within 1 or 2 pips (regardless of which classic edition you use). For
example, with attacks, the results are identical to Original D&D at 1st
level, and grow a bit more generous with advancing levels. Likewise, for
thief skills (assuming a 1 or 2 point Dexterity bonus), results are
identical to OD&D at 1st level, and then fall slightly behind at higher
levels. For a more detailed statistical analysis, [*please visit our
blog*](http://deltasdnd.blogspot.com/2018/02/target-20-system-accuracy.html).

  ------- ------------ -------- -------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Spell Casting**: Standard "Vancian" magic; Only 1 instance of a spell
can be memorized at a time.

**Spellbook**: Wizards start with a spellbook containing all 1^st^ level
spells. Each level of spells requires its own book. Replacement or
duplicate spellbooks require time and expense the same as learning
spells.

**Learning Spells**: Adding a new spell from a book or scroll requires a
roll of d20 + Wizard Level + Int modifier ≥ 20. Requires 1 day per spell
level (3 tries per spell)

**Spell Research**: Requires 1 week per spell level and a roll of d20 +
Wizard Level + Int Modifier ≥ 20. Access to a library or other resources
grant a +4 to the roll

**Spell Research**: Requires 1 week per spell level and a roll of d20 +
Wizard Level + Int Modifier ≥ 20. Access to a library or other resources
grant a +4 to the roll

**Magic Item Creation**: Takes 1 day and 100SP per spell
level/charge/use and the ability to cast the relevant spell(s). Note:
Treat potions of healing as a 1^st^ level spell, and Mithridate as 4^th^
level spell.

The DM will secretly roll a 1 in 20 chance for a mishap/cursed item.

Multi Classing

**Adding Classes**: A character must have a 16 or greater in the Prime
Requisite of the new class (Strength for Fighter, Dexterity for Thieves,
Intelligence for Wizards), and must pay 1000xp to add the new class.
*Note*: Elves begin play as a member of the Wizard class and one other
without needing to meet the above requirements.

**Experience Points**: After each adventure, the character applies all
earned XP to a single class of their choice.

**Benefits of Multiclassing**:

-   Uses best entry for Armor.
-   Uses best entry for Weapons.
-   Uses best value for Attacks
-   Uses highest class for Saves
-   Keep a separate HP tally for each class and use the higher of the
    two for your character's HP.
-   Fighter/Wizards may cast spells in Light (Leather) and Medium
    (Chain) armor as long as they do not employ a shield.
-   Fighter/Wizards may cast spells so long as they only wield 1 handed
    melee weapon, and have a free hand.
-   Thief skills can only be used in Light (Leather) armor.

Alignment

OED features 3 alignment options

*Lawful* beings want civilization peaceful and expanding; they take
prisoners, pay taxes, obey the king.

*Neutral* beings seek a balance, or are simply disinterested.

*Chaotic* beings want civilization broken down and destroyed; the never
take prisoners and stab each other in the back. PCs should list their
alignment as either neutral or lawful and secretly inform the DM.

Equipment

Money

**Starting Money**: 3d6x10 ***Si****lver*** Pieces (SP).

**Silver Standard**: OED uses a Silver standard for money. A Silver
Piece in OED has the buying power of a GP in traditional sources. In
published sources replace references to "gold pieces' with "silver
pieces", keeping original amount. Silver becomes Copper, Platinum
becomes Gold and so on.

**Calculating Costs**: For items not listed, take the historical value
in shillings and multiply by 3 for SP cost.

**Monthly Upkeep**: Equal to 1% of current XP (of highest class) in
Silver Pieces, minimum 20sp. Paid monthly. If unpaid, the character
suffers -10% to Attack rolls and HP, cumulative per month.

Encumbrance

OED measures the encumbrance value of items in "stone", roughly
equivalent to the historical unit. Characters can carry a number of
stone equal to their Strength. A character's encumbrance affects their
movement rate as shown below. This encumbrance level also functions as a
modifier to some rolls.

Encumbrance LevelStone CarriedEffect

Level 1up to 2/3 StrengthMovement Reduced 1/3: 9"(45')

Level 2up to Strength ScoreMovement Reduced 1/2 : 6"(30')

Level 3up to 2x Strength ScoreMovement Reduced to 0

Weapons

Weapons in OED fall into 4 types, Light, Medium, Heavy, and Ammo.

Weapons have 5 main properties.

**Swords**: Can be drawn and used in a single round.

**Spears**: Can be used to attack from the 2^nd^ rank (+5') reach)

**Axes**: +2 to hit targets in Medium/Heavy armor, or creatures with a
tough hide (AC 5 or better)

**Clubs**: +4 to hit targets in Heavy armor, or creatures with a very
tough hide (AC 3 or better)

**Ranged/Thrown**: -1 to Hit per 10', See also Firing at a Crowd below.

Armor

Armor in OED comes in 4 types, Light (Leather), Medium (Chain), Heavy
(Plate), and Shields. Leather and Chain armor takes 1 minute to put on,
Plate takes 10 minutes and requires assistance.

Gameplay

The core mechanic of OED is the Target 20 roll as summarized below. Some
game actions are resolved on an X in 6 chance using a d6 (see
Adventuring)

**Melee Attacks**: d20 + Attack Bonus + Str Modifier + Target AC ≥ 20

**Ranged Attacks**:d20 + Attack Bonus + Dex Modifier + Target AC ≥ 20

**Saving Throws**: d20 + Level + Save Mod ≥ 20

*Save TypeSave Mod*

Spells+0

Breath+1

Stone+2

Wands+3

Death+4

**Ability Checks:** d20 + Level + Modifier ≥ 20

**Thief Skills:** d20 + Thief Level + Dex Modifier ≥ 20

**Learn/Research Spell:**d20 + Wizard Level + Int Modifier ≥ 20

Adventuring

Scale, Movement, and Time

**Scale**: OED uses the below scale for dungeon combat. For battlefield
scale see [*Book of
War.*](http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/original-edition-delta-book-of-war/11207461)

UnitScale

1 round10 seconds

1 turn 1 minute

1' on table5 feet or 1"pace"

**Movement**: All player races move at a rate of 60' per round,
equivalent to a light jog. A fast jog is double this (120'), a run is
double again (240', sustainable for a few minutes), and a full sprint
would be 300' sustainable for but a round. Walking is half (30').

**Time:** Assume that the amount of time spent searching and exploring
is analogous to actual time spent. This will result in checking for
wandering monsters every 15 minutes of real time, adding a check for
long searches (such as for secret doors, etc.).

**Light and Vision**

**Lighting: **Torches and lanterns shed good light out to 30', and dim
light out to 60'. In dim light one can make out basic shapes and/or
glowing eyes.

**Infravision**: Infravision allows one to see (most) creatures in
darkness clearly out to ½ the specified distance (30') and dimly out to
the full listed distance (60'). It is spoiled when looking directly at a
torch/fire source.

**Darkness/Blindness:** []{#anchor}Creatures unable to see suffer a -4
penalty to AC and melee attacks. They cannot make ranged attacks (see
errant shots below), move at half speed, and suffer -1 to morale.

**Adventuring Tasks**

In OED a number of tasks are resolved with a d6 roll. The chance for
success is listed as X in6, and can be modified a number of "pips"
(numbers) up or down by circumstance or race/class ability.

TaskChanceModifiers

Climbing2 in 6+ Dexterity *Bonus*; Encumbrance Level (0-3); +2 for using
a rope.

Detection2 in 6+ Intelligence *Bonus*

Doff Armor3 in 6Chance per round, Leather and Chain Only

Force a Door2 in 6+ Strength *Bonus*: Locks/Bars -2, Reinforced Gates
-4, Solid Metal -6

Swimming2 in 6\*+ Strength *Bonus*; -\# of Stone Stone carried; +/- 1
for water conditions

Tracking4 in 6\*\*+/- 1 small or large parties, inclement weather, and
the like

\*Fighters and Thieves gain a +2 as noted in their class description,
for a base 4 in 6 chance.

\*\*Fighters with the Tracking feat only

**Climbing**: When climbing you move at half speed on a successful
check. A failed check is stalled movement. If you fail the roll by 2
pips or greater you fall.

**Climbing with Rope**: Grants a +2 to the roll and allows one to move
downward at up to 4x speed. A sharp jolt while on the rope results in a
1 in 20 chance for the rope to break.

**Hauling with Rope:** A character can haul a load safely up or down a
rope equal to their Strength score in Stone. A sharp jolt while on the
rope results in a 1 in 20 chance for the rope to break.

**Detection: **Used to find a secret door, listen at a door, discover a
trap, etc. Listening can not be done while wearing a helmet.

**Doff Armor: **It takes 1 round (each) to remove a shield, helm, or
backpack. Leather and Chain armor have a 3 in 6 chance per round. Plate
requires 3 turns to remove with assistance.

**Force a Door: **Limited to one character per door panel. Special tools
(ropes, ram, etc.) will allow the summation of all character's Strength
modifiers.

**Jumping: **A running jump will allow a creature to cover a distance of
d6×3 feet, - encumbrance level. Half again for a long jump, half again
for a vertical jump.

**Swimming:** When swimming you move at half speed on a successful
check. A failed check is stalled movement. If you fail the roll by 2
pips or greater you sink (see Drowning/Suffocation). You may swim at
full speed with a -2 to the check.

Hazards

In general, all spells and harmful effects should require an attack or
allow some form of saving throw to either negate the effect or result in
half effect/damage.

**Diseases:** When exposed to a disease hazard, a Save vs Breath will
avoid Strength damage for the day. Recovery requires bed rest.

*Rat Plague*: -1d12 Strength per day. Recover 3 Strength per week of
rest

*Tick Fever*: -1d6 Strength per week. Recover 1 Strength per week of
rest

*Leech Fever*: -1 Strength per day. Recover 3 Strength per week of rest

*Mummy Rot*: -1 Strength per day. Recovery (See Magic Diseases below)

**Magic Diseases: **Magical disease such as Lycanthropy and Mummy Rot
can be removed via the Remove Curse spell in place of the Remove Disease
spell.

**Drowning/Suffocation**: You have a 50% chance each round without air
to suffer 1 point of damage (1d3 if surprised). You also suffer 1d6
damage per Turn (minute) without air. Damage is doubled if surprised.

**Falling**: Suffer 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen (Max 50d6). A
successful Save vs Stone halves the damage. Damage may be modified by 1
or 2 pips per die based on landing surface.

**Level Drain**: Characters are allowed a Save vs Death to avoid Level
Drain effect. If the save is failed, XP is set to the midpoint of the
prior level. Current and Max HP are reduced proportionally (divide by
original level), possibly resulting in death at 0hp. The number of lost
HP should be noted and returned if/when the level is re-achieved.

**Poison: **Unless otherwise specified, a failed save vs poison means
incapacitation, then death in 1d6 rounds. Normal animals may have
delayed or non-fatal effect (HP damage, Incapacitation, etc.)

Combat

**Surprise**: Parties are surprised on a roll of 2 in 6. If the foes are
unseen (hidden, invisible, elven cloak, etc.) the chance is increased by
2 pips. If the foes are silent (motionless, undead, moving silently,
etc.) the chance is increased by 2 pips. A warning (the presence of
light, noisy action, magic detection, etc.) negates the surprise roll. A
party with the advantage of surprise gets a free round of action before
initiative is rolled.

**Initiative**: Roll a d6 per side; high rolling side goes first; ties
go to players. Players declare and resolve actions around the table in
order.

**Actions**: On their turn, characters can move and then take an action,
in that order. The following actions *disallow* movement during that
round:

-   Casting a Spell
-   Set a Pike
-   Retrieve a Scroll
-   Use a Retrieved Scroll
-   Retrieve and Use a Potion
-   Ranged Attacks (unless a weapon thrown in the same direction as the
    character's movement)

**Fleeing: **A creature can flee combat and does not draw a free attack
at its back, but does suffer the penalty for attacks to the rear.

**Withdraw: **In combat a creature can move up to half their speed
without turning their back on the enemy, preventing an attack against
the rear flank.

**Natural 1**: A roll of 1 on a d20 counts as a -10. On attack rolls,
the Judge rolls a d20 with the following results: 1 = Hit Self, 2 = Hit
Ally, 3 = Slip & Fall, 4 = Damage Weapon, 5 = Drop Weapon, 6+ = No
Fumble.

**Natural 20: **A roll of 20 counts as a 30. On attacks rolls, roll
damage twice with all bonuses included.

**Combat Modifiers**: The following situational modifiers may be added
to attack rolls.

Attacks to the target's rear: +2 to hit & To hit roll ignores shield AC.

Attacker is silent or unseen: +4 to hit

Target is stunned, stationary: +4 to hit

Target is helpless:+6 to Ranged attacks; Automatic Melee attacks for
full damage

Target has no Helmet:1 in 6 chance attack is to the head vs AC 9
(humanoids only)

**Shots at Groups: **When firing at a specific individual in a crowd, if
the attack roll (d20+To Hit+Dex Modifier+Range/Attack Modifiers; but
*not* AC) is less than 10, it misses the (man-size) target.

An "**errant shot**" is triggered if that attack roll is between 10 and
10 minus the number of creatures in the group. Ex: If the target is in a
squad of 5 other men, an errant shot occurs on 5-9. If the target group
has 10 men, then a roll of 0-9 indicates an errant shot.

**Errant Shots: **When making a ranged attack to hit any target in a
crowd (or on a fumbled attack against a specific target in a crowd), the
attack is resolved by d20+AC ≥ 20. Range penalties are ignored.

Death and Healing

**Zero Hit Point**s: When a character reaches or goes below 0 hit
points, they must immediately make a Save vs Death. Failure means the
character is Dead. Success results in the character stabilizing at 0HP,
waking in 1d6 turns, in an incapacitated state. Any healing (returning
the character to 1 HP) will restore normal activity.

**Natural Healing**: Creatures regain a number of Hit Points equal to
Level (Hit Dice) + Con *Bonus* per week of rest and comfort. The
creature can not undergo other meaningful activities.

**Magical Healing: **The only common source of magical healing in OED
are potions of healing and potions of mithridate (neutralize poison)
which are available from Wizards and NPC Alchemists. There is no common
source of regeneration, resurrection, or restoration magic.

**Character Death**: Players can bring in a new 1^st^ level character at
the completion of current combat/activity.

Spells

OED makes the below spells available to the Wizard class. Spell
attributes and effects have been standardized and are available in
the[]{#anchor-1} [*OED Book of
Spells*](http://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/original-edition-delta-book-of-spells-2nd-edition/15995854).

NPCs

It is recommended that the Judge keep a short roster of basic NPC info
(names, stats, personality).

NPC types can be generate randomly below.

**Ability Scores: **As below based on level.

**Race**: 1-3 (Human), 4 (Halfling), 5 (Dwarf), 6 (Elf)

**Class**: 1-3 (Fighter), 4-5 (Thief), 6 (Wizard -- roll again for Elf)

**Alignment**: 1 (Lawful), 3-5 (Neutral), 6 (Chaotic-Hidden)

The Judge should run the NPC initially and for the next session generate
full stats for the player's reference including personality, (public)
alignment, morale, equipment, and treasure share.

NPC's bequeath their belongings to their next of kin.

Zero Level Characters

**Generation**: Normal folk are assumed to be 0 Level. Their Ability
Scores are generated via 3d6 in order. They have 1d6 Hit Points. Their
attack and saves bonuses are +0. They can make use of up to 3 weapons
(ex: Sling, Sword, Pike). They possess -1,000 xp.

**Advancing to 1**^**st**^** Level**: When earning 1000xp, to arrive at
0xp, the character can enter one of the three basic classes. Entry to a
class presumes they have undergone one of the following: An act of
combat for Fighter, an act of larceny for a Thief, learning the Read
Magic spell for Wizard. Entry into the Fighter class grants +1HP, entry
into the Wizard class removes 1 HP (minimum 1).

Higher Level Characters

**Ability Scores:** For characters levels 1 -3, generate scores normally
(2d6+6 for one, 3d6 in order for the rest). Levels 4-7, generate two
scores via 2d6+6, 3d6 in order for the rest. Level 8 or greater:
Generate one score via 2d4+10, two more via 2d6+6, and the rest 3d6 in
order.

**Hit Points:** High-level characters re-roll Hit Point rolls of 1 or 2
for all their levels at the time of generation, then progress normally.

**Languages**: Give one extra language per level up to Intelligence
limit.

**Equipment**: Can select any mundane bit of gear to carry on person,
encumbrance permitting.

**Spellsbooks**: Randomly generate a Wizards spellbook using the table
on Supplement 1 page 8, or use the [*Wizard Spellbook
Generator*](http://deltasdnd.blogspot.com/2017/07/saturday-software-wizard-spellbook.html).
Generally, give the maximum number of low level spells, the minimum
number of high level spells, and extrapolate in between (See Spells
above)

**Magic Items**: For *every* level of the character's highest class;
roll a d6 for *each* of the below magic item categories. A result of 1
awards that magic item. Ex. a 6^th^ level character would a d6 six times
to see if they get a Sword or Wand, then a d6 six more times for Armor
or Scroll, and so on.

Sword or Wand

Armor or Scroll

Potion

Weapon, Ring, or Misc. (roll 1d3 to determine which it is)

Each additional "hit" for a given item type indicates an additional +1
bonus, dosage, or ability.

Hirelings

**Posting Advertisements:** Every 100sp spent on posts/agents will
attract 1d3 first level recruits within 1d6 days. The maximum number of
potential recruits is equal to 1% of the settlements population
(approximately 3 such folks in a typical hamlet). Populations will
refresh once per season. Calls to far, elf, or dwarf lands will multiply
the cost and time.

**Offers and Shares:** The default rate for a Hireling is 100sp plus a
"half share" of the treasure (and XP) split. The NPC will accept this
offer based on the outcome of a reaction roll (2d6+Cha Mod ≥ 9). The
roll can be modified by the quality of the offer.

Specialists

Various specialists can be hired, typically for the rate of 10sp per
day. These will often be zero level characters (see above) and they will
not enter dungeons or hazardous areas.

Sage

A sage can Identify the properties of magic items. The process takes one
day and will reveal a single property or command word per instance. A
sage can also do research on behalf of the party at a cost of 10sp per
day, using the guidelines below:

Judge knows the answer:General Topic = d6 hoursSpecific Topic = d6
daysJudge needs to Invent Info:General Topic = d6 daysSpecific Topic =
d6 weeks

Alchemist

Alchemists can provide potions of healing and mithridate (neutralize
poison) at the listed prices, taking a week to produce one dose. They
may also be able to brew other potions if given a sample.

Reaction/Morale Checks

Hirelings, NPCs, and Monsters will be called on to make reaction/morale
checks which are resolved by a roll of 2d6 + NPC Level/HD and compare
against the below table.

**ResultReactionMorale**

2May Attack, Surrender

3-5Hostile ReactionFlee

6-8Uncertain, Can Try AgainWithdraw

9-11Accepts OfferFight On

12EnthusiasticFight to the Death

Morale Triggers

In combat, a 1/3 loss of forces will trigger a morale check. Other
triggers include: death of leader, when left alone, and when ordered
into a dangerous situation.

Rumors

**Procuring Rumors**: Characters can "buy" rumors at character creation
or throughout gameplay. The cost is 1d6x10 sp, which represents buying

Rewards

Treasure

**Silver Standard**: OED uses a Silver standard for money. A Silver
Piece in OED has the buying power of a GP in traditional sources. In
published sources, replace references to "gold pieces' with "silver
pieces", keeping original amount. Silver becomes Copper, Platinum
becomes Gold and so on.

**Calculating Value**: For mundane items, take the historical value in
shillings x3 for SP value.

**Treasure Hordes**: The Judge should place one or two "big hauls" on
the first few levels of the dungeon, such as a magic item or gems &
jewels. These hauls serve as a "call to action" for starting parties.

For any empty rooms in a dungeon, there is a 1 in 6 chance that a
(hidden) treasure is present.

For rooms with monsters, there is a 3 in 6 chance that treasure is
present.

The table below dictates the type of treasure present.

**Wands/Staves**: Wands can hold a maximum of 20 charges and have d10+10
charges when found. Staves can have a maximum of 40 charges and have
d20+20 charges when found.

**Magic Item Saves: ** Grant a +2 bonus to saves and rolls to resist
harm for each plus or special ability.

**Intelligent Swords**: When in conflict; d20 + (Character Intelligence
& Charisma) - (Sword Ego & Intelligence) + Wound Modifier ≥ 20. You can
jot down the simplified formula in the Sword stats. *Wound Modifier*:
Full HP = +15, Half or more = +10, Less than Half = +5

Experience Points

In OED, characters gain Experience Points for the recovery of treasure,
defeat of monsters, and carousing. *Ability Scores (Prime Requisites) do
not modify XP earned*.

**XP for Treasure**: Character's earn 1 Experience Point for each Silver
Piece value of coin, gems, jewelry they return to civilization.

**XP for Monsters**: The base XP for monsters is equal to 100 x
(Equivalent) Hit Dice (see Monsters below)

**XP for Carousing**: When in town, players can spend d6x 100sp to
carouse, gaining an amount of xp equal to the coin spent (this amount
can be adjusted based on the size of the community). They must save vs
poison or suffer a mishap. If they cannot afford the rolled cost, they
also suffer a mishap. Mishaps can include; tavern brawls, jailed, a
tattoo, hangovers, or anything that could jump-start an adventure.

Carousing*](http://jrients.blogspot.com/2008/12/party-like-its-999.html)

Monsters

OED uses the monsters presented in Vol II with the adjustments below.

Monster Information

**Hit Dice**: All monsters use a d6 for their base Hit Dice, which is
used to calculate combat abilities.

**Equivalent Hit Dice**: Monsters in OED have an Equivalent Hit Dice
value that takes into account their special abilities and relative
power. This is used to determine monster encounters and XP rewards.

**Attacks**: Monster attacks are resolved by d20 + Hit Die + Target AC ≥
20. Monsters get a single attack per round unless otherwise noted.

**Monster Damage**: Monster damage is determined on a 1d6, unless
otherwise noted.

**Monster Strength:** If necessary, you can assume a Monster's Strength
modifier is equal to ½ its Hit Die.

**Magic to Hit**: For every 4 *natural* Hit Die a creature possesses, it
is capable of harming creatures that normally require +1 magic weapon to
hit.

**Languages:** It is assumed than an intelligent creature has a base 1
in 6 chance to speak common.

**Gaze Attacks: **Creatures facing beings with Gaze Attacks must make a
Save each round unless precautions are taken.

**Chimera/Gorgons: **Each round roll a 2d6, a result of 7+ means the
creature will use its breath weapon. It can use its breath weapon a
total of 3 times per day.

**Dragons: **Divide the Dragon's HP by 3 to determine its Hit Dice. Use
this Hit Dice value to determine Attacks and Saves. []{#anchor-2}Each
round roll a 2d6, a result of 7+ means the creature will use its breath
weapon. It can use its breath weapon a total of 3 times per day. A
Dragon's breath weapon does 1 die of damage for every 6 hit points it
currently possesses. Dragons can force a morale check on NPCs within 75
feet. They have a 2 in 6 chance to detect creatures within 75 feet.
Dragon subdual rules are not used.

**Goblin-kin: **Goblins, Orcs, and Kobolds suffer a -4 to attack, and -1
to Morale in full daylight.

**Giants**: Giants can throw a stone every other round at ranges of of
100' to 140'. Giant melee attacks are 1d10 +Str bonus. Giant garb is
equivalent to Leather armor on top of naturally tough skin (+3 AC).

**Horses**: Non-Warhorses are unusable in combat, near to fire or
smells, etc. (auto-fail morale)

**Slimes**: Successful attacks by these creatures will cause metal to
corrode instantly. Metal weapons used against them will corrode on a
successful attack. Wood is consumed at too slow a rate to affect combat.

**Undead**: Undead are (mostly) immune to backstabs, critical hits,
death effects, and mental attacks.

**Skeletons**: Skeletons are 1 Hit Die monsters

**Vampires**: Vampires can summon 1d10 Rats (AC 7, Mv 75', HD 1/6 (1HP),
Att +0, Dmg 1) or 3d6 Wolves (AC 7, Mv 90', HD 2+2, Att +1, Dmg 1d6)

**Zombies**: Zombies are 2 Hit Die monsters

Monster Placement

Within the dungeon, there is a 2 in 6 chance a monster is present in any
unallocated space (See Monster Determination below)

Wandering Monsters

**Checks**: Make a 1 in 6 check for wandering monsters using the below
guidelines:

-   Every 15 minutes of real time play.
-   During long searches, such as those for secret doors, etc.
-   On the parties exit from dungeon.
-   In the presence of loud/combat noise.

If a wandering monster result is indicated, use the Monster
Determination information below. Multiple parties of monsters may attack
one another. On a near miss (result of 5), give a hint that monsters are
present (ex: distant monster noise).

Monster Determination

To determine the type of monster encountered, roll a d6 and consult the
result against the level of the dungeon (depth) in question. This will
give you the "Threat" rank (I -- VI) of the monster.

  --------------------- ----------- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----
  Dungeon Level Depth   d6 Result

Number Appearing

When stocking a dungeon, the numbers of monsters appearing dependent on
the relation between the Equivalent Hit Die of the creature and dungeon
level (presuming a traditional party of 4)

EHD vs Dungeon Level No of monsters appearing

Dungeon is greater by 3 or more(1d4+1)\*3 (11)

Dungeon is greater by 1 or 2(1d4+1)\*2 (7)

Equal1d4+1 (4)

EHD is greater by 1 or 2(1d4+1)/2 (2)

EHD is greater by 3 or more(1d4+1)/3 (1)

For a wandering monster encounter, cut the above number in half.

For a more detailed breakdown of this formula and approach, see:

Appearing*](https://deltasdnd.blogspot.com/2018/05/underworld-overhaul-pt-4-monster.html)

Traps

When stocking a dungeon, there is a 1 in 6 chance for a room to have a
trap.

Searching has a base 2 in 6 chance to spot a trap, and there is a base 2
in 6 chance (per creature) to trigger a trap. The judge may rule that a
trap resets in 1d6 turns

When a trap is indicated, roll a d6 and consult the result against the
level of the dungeon (depth) in question. This will give you the
"Threat" rank (I -- VI) of the trap.

Finally roll a d12 and match the result to the given Threat rank.

Trap Descriptions

Pit Traps

The basic pit is 10×10×10\' and hidden by a cover unless a successful
search is made. It generally drops two characters. When triggered,
victims get saves vs. stone or fall in. In a standard depth pit,
resulting in 1d6 points of falling damage (save again for half). The
cover will reset in 1d6 turns unless noted.

A running jump over an open pit may be possible: Assume a jump distance
of d6×3 feet (minus encumbrance level).

For deeper dungeon levels (where the dungeon level is greater than trap
rank), add 10\' to pit depth (+1d6 damage) per level difference.

Optionally, convert any pit to a chute to a lower level.

Shooting Traps

The basic shooting trap attacks as a 3 Hit Die monster and fires the
listed number of projectiles randomly at characters in the trigger zone.

Slashing Traps

Slashing traps typically come out of cunningly concealed panels in the
walls or ceiling.

**Pendulum: **A poleaxe springs from the ceiling, attacking the
triggering character only as a 3 HD monster for 2d6 damage

**Scything Blade: **A Scythe springs out of the wall or other object,
attacking as a 3 HD monster. It strikes up to three characters for 2d6
damage

**Wall Spikes: **Spikes spring from holes in the walls. If these holes
are not covered by tapestries, foliage, plaster, etc.; grant characters
a +2 to search. When triggers, anyone within 5\' of the wall is attacked
by 1d3 protruding spikes. They strike as a 6 HD creature for 1d6 damage

**Door, Poison Needle: **A poison needle jabs out and quickly retracts
from doorknob or other protrusion. Character must save vs. death at +4
bonus. Note: Plate gauntlets are either open or leather on the inner
side, and are no protection against this trap

**Poison Scythe: **A Scythe springs out of the wall or other object,
attacking as a 9HD monster. It strikes up to three characters for 2d6
damage and they must save vs death

**Wall Spikes, Poison: **Spikes spring from holes in the walls. If these
holes are not covered by tapestries, foliage, plaster, etc.; grant
characters a +2 to search. When triggers, anyone within 5\' of the wall
is attacked by 1d3 protruding spikes and they must save vs death

Clubbing Traps

Clubbing traps are concealed within the architectural elements of the
structure.

**Ball Trap: **Countless steel balls drop to the floor, the sound of
which triggers a check for nearby monsters. Anyone moving through the
area must save vs. stone or fall and be stunned for 1d3 rounds. It takes
1d6 rounds for the balls to dissipate, ending the effect

**Royal Statue: **A statue of a king or other nobility swings at the
character with its scepter, attacking as a 6 HD monster for 2d6 damage

**Block, Swinging: **A large stone block swings down from the ceiling in
an arc that effect a 20 foot-long area, those in the area suffer 4d6
damage and can save vs. stone for half

**Block, Falling: **A large stone block falls from ceiling in 5×10 foot
area causing 6d6 damage, those caught can make a save vs. stone for half

save vs. stone for half

**Block, Falling, Spiked, Poison: **A large spiked stone block falls
from ceiling in 5×10 foot area causing 10d6 damage, those caught can
save vs. stone for half. The spikes are coated in poison and all those
in the area must also save vs. death.

Crushing Traps

Crushing traps, like clubbing traps, are concealed within the
architectural elements of the structure

**Door, Falling: **This heavy reinforced door springs off of its hinges
landing in 5×10 foot area when the character attempts to open it. It
inflicts 2d6 damage; targets can save vs. stone for half

**Rolling Rock: **A 8' diameter boulder is released down the passage
moving at 9" (45') per round; those struck take 4d6 damage and can save
vs. stone for half. The boulder comes to rest, blocking the passageway,
and can be moved by a party of 4 working in unison.

**Collapsing Column: **A non-load bearing column breaks apart with the
sections falling in a 10×10 foot area causing 4d6 damage, characters can
save vs. stone for half

**Collapsing Wall: **The outer layer of blocks on this wall collapse in
10\' long area causing 8d6 damage, those affected can save vs. stone for
half.

**Compacting Room: **The doors to this room are reinforced and will
swing shut and lock. If they are spiked open beforehand, the spikes have
a 4 in 6 chance to hold. The walls will close in 1d6+1 rounds causing
12d6 damage before retracting. Victims can save vs. death for half
damage.

**Crushing Wall: **This solid outer section of wall 20\' wide smashes
forward on trigger inflicting 16d6 damage and then retracts. Targets can
save vs death for half

Confining Traps

Confining traps are typically normal appearing rooms that restrict
movement. The Judge should familiarize themselves with the rules for
Forcing Doors, Swimming, etc.

**Net: **A net with hooks and bells drops from the ceiling, landing in
10' × 20' area, entangling those beneath, the sound of which triggers a
check for nearby monsters. Those in the net cannot move, suffer a -2
penalty to AC, and can only make melee attacks with swords and spears at
a -2 penalty. Creatures have a 1 in 6 plus Strength bonus chance per
round to escape. Having a dagger in-hand grants a +2 to this role.
Finally, check for nearby monsters when net falls.

**Portcullis: **An iron gate falls behind party and blocks the passage,
the sound of which triggers a check for nearby monsters. The bars may be
forced as locked door (base 2 in 6, with a --2)

**Watery Room: **The floor of the room is flooded with stagnant water at
least 10\' deep.

**Spinning Wall: **A section of wall up to 20' in length spins in place,
depositing the victims in area on adjacent side. It cannot be triggered
from the other side.

**Flooding Room: **The doors to this room are reinforced and will swing
shut and lock. If they are spiked open beforehand, the spikes have a 4
in 6 chance to hold. Once sealed, the room floods with water in 1d6
rounds. Once flooded, attempt to open the door attempts are at --2

**Dropping Ceiling: **The entire stone ceiling drops on the room when
triggered inflicting 12d6 damage to the occupants, who can save vs.
death for half). Passage through the room is then blocked.

Gas Traps

The basic gas trap covers a 20 × 20\' area with a cracking sound and
distinct smell. When triggered characters can make a save vs. stone,
allowing them to immediately flee the affected area. Those in the area
must save vs. breath each round to avoid the effect of the gas. The gas
clears after one hour.

**Gas, Obscuring: **A hazy gas fills the area imposing a --4 to attacks

**Gas, Sickness: **This sulfurous smelling gas causes the victims to
lose 1d6 points of Strength for one hour unless a save vs. breath is
made.

**Gas, Blinding: **This apple scented gas inflicts blindness for one
hour

**Gas, Poison: **This bitter almond scented gas forces the victims to
save vs. death with a +4 bonus

**Gas, Corroding:** This ammonia smelling gas will rust any metal items
in the area. Each item must succeed a save vs. stone or it falls to
pieces. Magic items get +2 bonus for each magic plus or ability.

**Gas, Insanity: **This fruity smelling gas causes the victim to become
permanently insane unless a save vs. breath is successful. Those
affected are equally likely to attack or flee from allies in any given
encounter. A *remove curse *spell will lift the affliction.

Energy/Magic Traps

While these traps may make use of magical effects, they are triggered
and detected in the same manner as other traps. Some mechanical
interface activates the magic, which is undetectable until that time.

**Boiling Oil: **Boiling oil dumps into a 10' radius area inflicting 2d6
points of fire damage. The targets can make a save vs. breath for half
damage.

**Fire Vent: **Flames belch out into a 10' radius inflicting 4d6 points
of fire damage. The targets can make a save vs. breath for half damage.

**Acid Vent: **Acid dumps into a 10' radius area inflicting 4d6 points
of fire damage. The targets can make a save vs. breath for half damage.

**Spells**: These traps work as under their spell description at the
lowest level required to cast. Trap-conjured Elementals are 8 HD
(small). For deeper dungeon levels (where the dungeon level is greater
than trap rank), add +2 to the caster level per degree of difference.

For even more spells, a GM can reference the [*Wizard's Spell
Compendium*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/17468/Wizards-Spell-Compendium-Vol-1-2e),
using the above spells as a guideline for streamlining the entry.

Castle Construction

When the time comes for a PC or party to establish their own stronghold,
they can construct a basic keep that is able to control 1 hex worth of
territory for a cost of 80,000 silver. Such a Keep requires 282

weeks (5.4 years) to build. They can quadruple the price to reduce the
build time by the same factor.

For basic gameplay, the Judge can presume that such a Keep can sustain
itself so far as staff, and basic soldiers under most circumstances. If
the PCs wish to explore the hiring of specialists or other economic
actives, there is a list of specialists, siege weaponry, etc. in Volume
III. (and perhaps a future expansion to this document)

If other sorts of construction are desired, one can take the square root
of the price found in Vol III (or the historical price in shillings x3)
as the number of weeks to build. Each multiplied cost factor divides
time by a like amount, up to quadruple cost/speed.

**Clerics **If thou must...

*Armor*: Light (Leather), Medium (Chain), Heavy (Plate), Shields

*Weapons*: Blunt Weapons (Crude Club, Staff, Sling, and weapons with the
"club" type)

**Turn Undead: ** A Cleric may brandish their Holy Symbol in order repel
the Undead. When doing so, the player rolls 1d6 + (Cleric Level -- 5),
with the result being the highest Hit Die of Undead affected. Up to 2d6
such creatures are affected (lowest Hit Die first). If the Cleric's
level exceeds the Undead's Hit Dice by 4 or more, the Undead is reduced
to 0 HP instead. Such an ability works to a range of 60', once per day
per given creature(s).

An Example Notation for a Cleric 10: "Turn Undead: HD= d6+5; 2d6
creatures, destroy 6HD or below."

**Spell Casting**: Standard "Vancian" magic; Only 1 instance of a spell
can be prepared at a time (no duplicates). To cast a spell a Cleric must
brandish their holy symbol with a free hand.

**Spells known**: Clerics start with knowledge of all the standard
Cleric spells in Vol 1.

**Learning Spells**: Should the Cleric encounter a new spell, it will
require a roll of d20 + Cleric Level + Wis modifier ≥ 20. Requires 1 day
per spell level (3 tries per spell)

**Magic Item Creation**: Takes 1 day and 100SP per spell
level/charge/use and the ability to cast the relevant spell(s). The DM
will secretly roll a 1 in 20 chance for a mishap/cursed item.

**Grievous Wounds**

When a character reaches or goes below 0 hit points, the character has
suffered a grievous wound and must roll on the tables below. Once for
location, and again for severity.

Tournaments and Contests

Archery

Each participant gets to take 6 shots at a dish sized target 30 feet
away backed by an earthen "butt". The target itself is AC 10, and some
targets will have inner rings of AC 5 and AC 0. Each hit on the target
scores 1 point. Inner rings are worth 2 or 3 points respectively. A
critical failure misses the butt entirely and may result in penalties.

In head-to-head competition, participants alternate shots. On a critical
hit, there is a 1 in 6 chance to strike and split the opponent's arrow.

Jousting (Simplified)

In a proper tournament joust, riders must wear plate armor and shield
with no enchantments. They make use of blunted lances (no double damage
from a charging mount). Participants take rides until one is unhorsed,
or breaks three lances.

Each ride, the participants roll their standard melee attack. On a hit,
the target must save vs stone. If the save is successful, the attacker's
lance breaks. If the save fails, the target is unhorsed. If the save is
a critical failure, the target also takes lance damage.

Melee Rumble

Up to 50 participants per side line up across a field in equal armor,
blunt clubs, and no enchantments. Melee proceeds as normal, but the
damage is non-lethal (0 HP only results in a Knock out). The event ends
when one side is entirely down or surrenders. This can also be resolved
quickly using Book of War.

Unarmed Attacks

When striking without a weapon (including strikes with just a
gauntlet/brass knuckles), the character suffers a -4 to hit and deals 1
(+Str *Bonus*) points of damage. An unarmored Fighter or Thief can punch
twice per round against a single target.
